# Keypress Automation

A macOS application that allows you to control any window using AI-powered key presses through a floating input box.

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

1. When you start the application, it will show a list of available windows
2. Select the window number you want to control
3. A floating input box will appear on the right side of your screen
4. Type your text and press Enter to simulate key presses in the selected window
5. You can drag the floating input box to reposition it

## Features

- Window selection from active windows
- Draggable floating input box
- Always-on-top input window
- Direct key press simulation

Note: Currently, the application directly simulates keypresses. Integration with an AI service needs to be implemented based on your specific requirements.
